abstract = {For a directed or undirected graph without loops we give formulae for the determinant and adjugate of matrices which carry their structure. In particular, we consider the in-degree and out-degree Laplacian and the adjacency matrix of a directed graph, and the Laplacian and adjacency matrix for an undirected graph.}
