abstract = {This paper studies the power flow feasibility of DC power grids with constant-power loads. We introduce and motivate the concept of Braess’ paradox for power flow feasibility, and show that this phenomenon can occur in most practical power grids with at least two source nodes. To combat Braess’ paradox we consider bounded parametric uncertainties in the power lines, and give a simple but conservative sufficient condition to guarantee that the power flow is feasible under these parametric uncertainties. We refer to this property as strong feasibility.}
