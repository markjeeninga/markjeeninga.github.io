abstract = {In this paper we study a power grid which consists of interconnected DC microgrids. These microgrids are equipped with constant-power loads, and the lines in the grid are assumed to be purely resistive. For this setup we present a sufficient condition which ensures that the power flow equations are feasible. The novelty of this condition is its plug-and-play property: If one would connect a new microgrid to the grid, there is a test for the new microgrid to guarantee that the interconnection satisfies this condition, and hence is feasible.}
